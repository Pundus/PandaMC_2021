**Welcome to the Lunar Advance Update!**
Return to the Moon in this latest content update to earn Advancements and work towards the new Lockbox: Lunar Advance!

This update includes 16 new Lockbox items, 2 new Quest items, and 24 new Community-themed eggs!

It also includes the new Quests system! Talk to any of the two current Quest givers, Dr. Wradin or Corporal Lance, to accept quests.

There are 5 currently available Quests, 3 from Wradin and 2 from Lance. Completing them provides different rewards for each Quest, including the `Starshot Bow` which can only be obtained from Corporal Lance's `Lunar Pest Control` Quest!

You can only have 1 Quest per Quest giver active, and each quest as a cooldown between availability once complete. You can also abandon quests if they are too difficult to complete.

**Lockbox: Lunar Advance Additions**

**{Ring] Lunar Advance**
Equipping this ring in your offhand on the Moon will cause any mobs you slay there to drop `Lunarite Shards`,

**Cosmic Cola**
Drinking this can of cola will emulate the effects of Lunar gravity!

**[Pet] Lunar Mining Drone**
A drone that follows you around, giving haste to any players near it. Attacking a mob with the drone active will cause the drone to attack for you. If the drone becomes fully submerged, it will be destroyed. Drone is consumed on use and lasts for 5 minutes.

**Darkheart**
The latest of the three Greatswords, the `Darkheart` heals 2 of your hearts when you kill a mob with it.

**Type I Phaser**
A directed energy weapon that shoots out stun bolts, capable of disabling any hostile mob hit with it, but dealing no damage. Can be upgraded into a damaging two-mode `Type II Phaser` using `Probability Pearls`.

**TNT Launcher**
Using *Fire Charges* as ammunition, this TNT Launcher fires gravity-defying blocks of Primed TNT!

Wearing these will cause you to emit an aura of light as long as you're standing in an air block!

**[Ring] The Long Haul**
Equipping this ring in your offhand will let you incrementally walk faster every 5 seconds, up to a stack of 3. At maximum stacks, you also gain Jump Boost I, but this cannot be used in combat.

**Sonic Pearl**
A custom-engineered *Ender Pearl* that can fly twice as fast. Be careful, if it exits loaded chunks, it won't continue flying while unloaded.

A sword made from a fish with Knockback XVI. Also allows you to swim faster while held in water, at the cost of losing 1 point of durability per second.

A consumable that deploys an orb of ball lightning for 30 seconds. Any hostile mobs that enter a 12 block radius of the Kugelblitz will be struck down by lightning.

**Replanting Soles**
A pair of leather shoes that, while on fresh farmland, will plant whatever seeds you have in your offhand for you!
