**Server change log XX/04/2021-A**

> Gameplay Changes
+ Added an internal check for combat status.
Being [In Combat] requires ANY of the following 3 predicates to be met:
Player has recently dealt damage
Player has recently received damage
There are hostile mobs within a 5 block radius.

+ Undead mobs and Pillagers now spawn with Volatile Equipment.
Volatile Equipment comes in every flavour (leather/wood, stone/chainmail, iron, gold, diamond, netherrite).
They have an 8.5% chance of dropping (affected by looting).
Volatile Equipment (armor, tools and weapons) can be used like normal equipment, but they cannot be repaired.
Grindstoning Volatile Equipment will give you the XP, but the item will be destroyed once held and cannot be sold.
They can be sold for Zombie Brains (varying amount depending on rarity of material) by placing it in your offhand and crouching (there is no chat prompt).

+ Eyric Carapaces now drop when mining ores or killing mobs in the Skylands.
When mining ores, a crack and particle now appears, and (an) Eyric Carapace(s) drops.
Number of Carapaces that drop vary depending on rarity of ore mined (up to 3).
Killing mobs in the Skylands drops an Eyric Carapace at your location.

+ Using the Lunar Express Ticket no longer deposits you at 0,0 on the Moon. It will now use your relative coordinates in the Overworld.
+ Every time the server is reloaded, all players online gain 10 seconds of invulnerability (in case an admin reloads during combat).

> World Changes

> Economy Changes
+ More Vanilla Minecraft items are now sellable.
Honeycomb, Ominous Banners.
++ Changed the price of some of the utilities in the Spawn Shop.
`
> Item Changes
+ Added the Lore Inscription Plate and the Lore Redacter.
Purchaseable for 300 and 150 respectively.
The Lore Inscription Plate can be used with any vanilla non-server item to append custom lore to the item.
The Lore Redacter removes all lines of lore from any vanilla non-server item.
Read their item's descriptions for more information and instructions.
(Due to technical reasons, lore will always appear as purple and italicized).

+ The Scepter of Spirit Shifting has been nerfed.
No longer works in the Nether (the Nether is already used for fast travel, and to prevent ceiling breaking).
Now requires player to be out of combat to be used.
Cooldown increased to 5 minutes.
Players no longer gain invulnerability for a few seconds after exiting Spirit Shift mode.
Shifted time reduced to 5 seconds (given that you can drastically increase speed while Shifted).

- You can now only use the Lunar Express Ticket in the Overworld.
This is to prevent the Nether Subspace Bubble from depositing you far outside the World Border when going to the moon.

+ The Spell of Dead Men Walking and the Scepter of Mindless Translocation now require valid targets within their respective AoE radii to activate
This is to prevent accidental activation, and brings it in line with other AoE attacks like the Reaping Scythe's functionality.

+ The Vorpal Blade's Vorpal Charge display on the HUD now displays more information and not just a loading bar.
+ Buffed the Meggnet (Radius of effect increased to 16 blocks, from 8).

> Technical Changes
+ Internal disambiguation of certain scoreboards to track items.

> Graphical Changes
- Removed the fancy chunk rendering shader.
It doesn't play well with certain aspects that I'd like kept for the Skylands.

+ Retextured the Vorpal Blade to be more Lunarite-y

> Egg Changes
+ Added a sound effect when Eggs disintegrate.

> Bug Fixes
= Increased detection time of Skylands Portals to prevent further false negatives.
= Added failsafe to ensure no Skylands Portals are auto-generated in the Overworld.
= Added lore specifying the Recall Device does not work in Mission Zones.
= Fixed the Meggnet requiring a dropped Egg <5 blocks away to activate, when the activation range is ~~8~~ 16 blocks.
